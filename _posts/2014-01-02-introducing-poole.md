title: Why I blog
---

This is my third attempt at writing something in my blog. My first attempt was in 2008 during the Football euro championships. My first blog post was about the euro championships and how
, my favorite team, Italy performed in that competition. I wanted to write only about Football because I wanted to be the know-it-all football pundit who analyzes games and writes
intelligent things. But that did not work out so well and at some point I lost interest
in writing about football games. Since I wanted my blog to be the one-stop shop
for football analysis and wasn't able to continue doing it I stopped writing all together.

The next attempt at blogging was in 2012 when I started doing my masters in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin. I was all excited about Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence and wanted to blog about what I read and understood about various algorithms.
Every new thing that I learned fascinated me and I was pretty excited to write about it.
Unlike the football blog posts where I gave my own insights about the game, I felt every
blog post that I came up about ML and AI were very redundant. There were blogs about
SVMs, PCA all over the internet. Some of them were really good and I in fact learnt quite
a lot by just reading from those blogs. Then I hit another mental block - where I realized
my blog was not contributing anything new or wasn't any better than the one I had already
learnt from. Then I decided to keep these posts private for me to lookup them up whenever
I needed to refresh things. So that was attempt two.

This is attempt three. And what is different now ? Well for starters I am trying Jekyll
and trying to be a hippie. But more than anything my perception on why I blog has changed.
This time I am not blogging about something specific and trying to gain spotlight
on being the ultimate authority on a topic. I have realized that my interests will change over time and I can't stick to one topic. I am not blogging to get a million views, I am not blogging for people to comment, I am not blogging to put it my on resume. This time
around I am blogging because I want to write. And here
